SQL Server Admin TSQL Scripts

This repo is a collection of T-SQL scripts I wrote while supporting SQL Server 2008 through 2016. Most are simply quality of life functions, while others such as my availability group SQL agent job rollover script sovled a significant problem with SQL 214.

While I cannot guarentee these will work on modern SQL Server you are welcome to give it a go.
